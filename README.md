# Color Picker

A simple and intuitive color picker application built with JSX. This tool allows users to select colors visually and retrieve their color codes. It’s especially helpful for designers, developers, and anyone who needs a quick way to generate or fine-tune colors.

## Features

- **Real-Time Preview** – See color changes instantly as you select from the palette or modify the sliders.
- **Color Code Formats** – Retrieve colors in HEX (and optionally RGB or HSL if supported in your code).
- **Interactive UI** – User-friendly controls make it easy to adjust color hue, saturation, and lightness.
- **Copy Function** – Quickly copy the color code for use in design tools or code editors.
